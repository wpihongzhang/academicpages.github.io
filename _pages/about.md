# About Me
* I am a biostatistician at the [Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc.](http://www.merck.com/research/mrl-labs.html). My work at Merck mainly focuses on identifying genetic markers that are associated with clinical endpoints, such as efficacy change-from-baseline, adverse events and PK/PD parameters, across phase I-III clinical trials in oncology, cardiology, neuroscience, and infectious diseases.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Finance from [Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/), Master's degree in Financial Mathematics from [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu/) and PhD in Statistics from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](http://www.wpi.edu/). My PhD advisor is Prof. [Zheyang Wu](http://users.wpi.edu/~zheyangwu/).
* My research interests include in 1) statistical theory of multiple comparison and p-value combination methods; 2) statistical methodology for genetic association study; 3) pharmacogenetics.
