<b>[SetTest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SetTest)</b><br> http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/SetTest
It provides cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, p-value, statistical power calculator and random number generator for a collection of group-testing procedures, including the Higher Criticism tests, the one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, the one-sided Berk-Jones tests, the one-sided phi-divergence tests, etc. The input are a group of p-values. The null hypothesis is that they are i.i.d. Uniform(0,1). In the context of signal detection, the null hypothesis means no signals. In the context of the goodness-of-fit testing, which contrasts a group of i.i.d. random variables to a given continuous distribution, the input p-values can be obtained by the CDF transformation. The null hypothesis means that these random variables follow the given distribution.

<b>[TFisher](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TFisher)</b><br> 
It provides the cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, and statistical power calculator for a collection of thresholding Fisher's p-value combination methods, including Fisher's p-value combination method, truncated product method and, in particular, soft-thresholding Fisher's p-value combination method which is proven to be optimal in some context of signal detection. The p-value calculator for the omnibus version of these tests are also included. For reference, please see Hong Zhang and Zheyang Wu.

<b>[CKAT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CKAT)</b><br> 
Composite Kernel Association Test (CKAT) is a flexible and robust kernel machine based approach to jointly test the genetic main effect and gene-treatment interaction effect for a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pharmacogenetics (PGx) assessments embedded within randomized clinical trials.
