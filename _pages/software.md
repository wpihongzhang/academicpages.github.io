<b>[SetTest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SetTest)</b> ![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/SetTest?color=yellowgreen)<br> 
It provides cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, p-value, statistical power calculator and random number generator for a collection of group-testing procedures, including the Higher Criticism tests, the one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, the one-sided Berk-Jones tests, the one-sided phi-divergence tests.

<b>[TFisher](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TFisher)</b> ![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/TFisher?color=yellowgreen)<br> 
It provides the cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, and statistical power calculator for a collection of thresholding Fisher's p-value combination methods, including Fisher's p-value combination method, truncated product method and, in particular, soft-thresholding Fisher's p-value combination method. The p-value calculator for the omnibus version of these tests are also included.

<b>[CKAT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CKAT)</b> ![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/CKAT?color=yellowgreen)<br> 
Composite Kernel Association Test (CKAT) is a flexible and robust kernel machine based approach to jointly test the genetic main effect and gene-treatment interaction effect for a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pharmacogenetics (PGx) assessments embedded within randomized clinical trials.

<b>[Qapprox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Qapprox)</b> ![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/Qapprox?color=yellowgreen)<br> 
Calculates the right-tail probability of quadratic forms of Gaussian variables using the skewness-kurtosis ratio matching method, modified Liu-Tang-Zhang method and Satterthwaite-Welch method.
